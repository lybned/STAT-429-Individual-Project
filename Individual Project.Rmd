Read the data
```{r}

lifeExpectData<-read.table("temp.csv", header=TRUE,sep = ",")


```


Remove some of the irrelavent predictorts
```{r}
lifeExpectData2 <- lifeExpectData[,!(names(lifeExpectData) %in% c("Country","Year", "thinness..1.19.years", "thinness.5.9.years"))]



```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
